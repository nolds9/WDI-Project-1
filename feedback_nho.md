# Project Feedbac

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Meets Expectations**. Your project is falls appropriately into the scope of a first project and your user stories show that. In the future, it would be nice to see more thoughts from your planning process, like a trello board with current, backlog, and icebox user stories, and relevant wireframes.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations**. Congratulations.  All the concepts covered during the first few week of WDI are represented.  You have tackled some complex problems. I recommend you come back to this and I bet you'd be surprised how much clearer it will be with a fresh perspective.

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations**. Html is clearly structured, CSS is clear, and JS works, I recommend you check your code in a validator.  Make sure to clean up code, remove comments, fix indentation in the future. Moving forward, try to watch for duplication and areas where you can group functionality into functions.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Meets Expectations **. Excellent excellent job on this project! I would really like to see you implement the features letting users know their score and when they got their turn wrong.
